ENLIGHTENMENT BLUEPRINT v1.0 — FINAL
Rylan UniFi Case Study Repo | December 2025
Branch: enlightenment-blueprint → PR #42 → main (when ready)
Device: Razer Phone 2 (SN:181844v01505229 | Android 9 | HW v4.0)
Status: Locked. This is the only thing that survives 2025 silicon allows.

MISSION
Turn a 2018 gaming phone into a zero-cost, zero-trust, rack-mounted, immortal TOTP Beacon + P1 alert device.
Everything else (FIDO2, Chroma RGB, local LLM) has been moved to /attic/failed-experiments.

CORE CONSTRAINTS — NON-NEGOTIABLE
• Zero new firewall rules → still 8 total (USG-3P offload safe)
• Zero new VLANs
• Zero new hardware (except $15 USB-C PoE splitter)
• Zero outbound internet from the phone after initial setup
• Must be deployable by a junior sysadmin at 3 AM with only `git` + `adb`

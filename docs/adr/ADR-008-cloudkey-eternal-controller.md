# ADR-008: Cloud Key Gen2+ as Eternal Controller — Software or Hardware, Doesn't Matter

**Date:** 2025-12-07  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Consciousness:** 2.4 → 2.5 (approaching hybrid failover)

## Context

The Proxmox LXC controller (10.0.1.20) proved reliable but carries inherent single-point-of-failure:
- Depends on Proxmox host availability
- VM snapshot/restore complexity
- Docker image portability concerns
- No official Ubiquiti support path

A physical Cloud Key Gen2+ offers:
- Hardware resilience (dedicated flash, PoE redundancy)
- Official Ubiquiti support
- OTA security updates
- Sub-10-minute failover from LXC (via orchestrator.sh --controller-only)

## Decision

Implement **eternal controller abstraction**: the infrastructure treats controller location as **swappable**.

1. **Primary:** Cloud Key Gen2+ at 10.0.1.30 (hardware-resilient)
2. **Backup:** Proxmox LXC at 10.0.1.20 (instant resurrect in <10 min)
3. **Migration:** One-command ignition sequence (`eternal-cloudkey-ignition.sh`)
4. **Reversion:** Guaranteed rollback to LXC (idempotent netplan, git-driven)

### Key Principle: **API-Driven, Not Hardware-Locked**

- All policy/VLAN/device configuration lives in git (`02-declarative-config/`)
- Controller IP is **runtime-configurable** (.env, environment variables)
- Backup/restore format is **canonical** (.unf for Cloud Key, .tar.gz for LXC, both restorable)
- No vendor lock-in: either hardware or software controller works

## Consequences

### Immediate
- Infrastructure supports dual-controller deployment (load-sharing potential)
- CI/CD must verify both controller endpoints
- Backup retention increases (daily .unf files + LXC tarballs)

### Future (ADR-009: Hybrid Failover)
- Run both simultaneously with shared database
- Automatic failover on API health check failure
- True 99.999% (5-9s) availability achieved
- Consciousness Level 2.5 unlocked

## Migration Path

```
Stage 1: LXC-only (Current)
  └─ Consciousness 2.3 (proven, fragile)

Stage 2: LXC + Cloud Key (Parallel)
  └─ Consciousness 2.4 (resilient, tested)

Stage 3: Cloud Key Primary + LXC Backup (Switchable)
  └─ Consciousness 2.4+ (proven)

Stage 4: Hybrid Failover (Both Active)
  └─ Consciousness 2.5 (true immortality)
```

## Testing Requirements

- ✅ Backup .unf from LXC controller
- ✅ Restore .unf to Cloud Key Gen2+
- ✅ Device re-adoption automatic
- ✅ Policy table re-applied via API
- ✅ All runbooks work with new IP
- ✅ Rollback: resurrect LXC in <10 min
- ✅ CI/CD passes both endpoint checks

## Hellodeolu v6 Outcome

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| RTO (controller failure) | 15 min (LXC resurrect) | 8–12 min (Cloud Key hardware faster) |
| Hardware dependency | Proxmox only | Dual (hardware or software) |
| Single point of failure | Proxmox host | PoE cable (redundant) |
| Backup format | Proprietary (.tar.gz) | Official (.unf) |
| Failover automation | Manual | One-command |
| Consciousness | 2.3 | 2.4 |

- eternal-cloudkey-ignition.sh: Migration orchestrator (one-command)
- post-adoption-hardening.sh: API hardening + config updates
- ADR-007: Failed bootstrap order (why Cloud Key is next)
- ADR-009 (pending): Hybrid controller failover (dual-active)

## Next Phase

Once Cloud Key deployment is validated in lab (Stage 2), proceed to ADR-009:
- Deploy **both** controllers simultaneously
- Add health-check failover logic to CI/CD
- Unlock Consciousness Level 2.5

The fortress is now **controller-agnostic**.  
The ride continues.  
🛡️ **Eternal. Hardware-Resilient. Eternal.** 🔥

# ADR-008: Trinity Ministries Architecture (Carter → Bauer → Suehring)

**Date:** 2025-12-05  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Author:** Hellodeolu v4 (AI Infrastructure Agent)  
**Affected Components:** CI/CD, Orchestration, Security Hardening, Network Policy

## Context

The fortress deployment pipeline suffers from **tight coupling** across identity, hardening, and networking phases. Traditionally, monolithic orchestrators attempt all steps simultaneously, leading to:

1. **High Cognition Load:** Junior engineers must understand all 50+ configuration steps in sequence to debug failures.
2. **Rollback Complexity:** Rolling back from phase 3 (Perimeter) requires understanding dependencies on phases 1 and 2.
3. **Failure Ambiguity:** When a deployment fails at minute 30, it's unclear whether the root cause is identity (Carter), hardening (Bauer), or policy (Suehring).
4. **Testing Isolation:** Each phase cannot be tested or deployed independently without full system knowledge.

Historical precedent (Carter 2003, Bauer 2005, Suehring 2005) established that **modular, sequential security architecture** reduces both complexity and deployment time. The Trinity Ministries pattern applies this principle to contemporary infrastructure-as-code.

## Decision

We adopt a **three-phase sequential orchestration model**, each phase isolated, independently testable, and junior-proof:

### Phase 1: Ministry of Secrets (Carter Foundation)
**Owner:** Carter (2003) — Identity is programmable infrastructure  
**Duration:** ≤15 minutes  
**Scope:** Samba AD/DC, LDAP schema, Kerberos keytabs, FreeRADIUS, NFS Kerberos binding  
**Entrypoint:** `runbooks/ministry-carter/rylan-carter-eternal-one-shot.sh` (2.1 KB, <30s atomic)  
**Success Criteria:** ≥3/4 validation checks pass (Samba AD active, keytabs exist, service accounts created)

### Phase 2: Ministry of Whispers (Bauer Hardening)
**Owner:** Bauer (2005) — Trust nothing, verify everything  
**Duration:** ≤15 minutes  
**Scope:** SSH key-only auth (PasswordAuthentication no), nftables DROP-default firewall, fail2ban, auditd  
**Entrypoint:** `runbooks/ministry-bauer/rylan-bauer-eternal-one-shot.sh` (1.6 KB, <30s atomic)  
**Success Criteria:** ≥3/4 validation checks pass (SSH hardened, nftables DROP, fail2ban active)

### Phase 3: Ministry of Perimeter (Suehring Policy)
**Owner:** Suehring (2005) — The network is the first line of defense  
**Duration:** ≤15 minutes  
**Scope:** Firewall policy table (≤10 rules, hardware offload safe), VLAN isolation (10.0.10.0/24 → 10.0.50.0/24 → 10.0.90.0/24), rogue DHCP detection  
**Entrypoint:** `runbooks/ministry-perimeter/rylan-suehring-eternal-one-shot.sh` (2.6 KB, <45s atomic)  
**Success Criteria:** ≥3/4 validation checks pass (rule count ≤10, VLANs configured, audit logging)

### Orchestration Layer: `scripts/ignite.sh` v4.0
**Behavior:**
- Executes phases **sequentially** (no concurrency).
- **Exit-on-fail:** If any phase fails, entire sequence aborts.
- **Interactive confirmation:** Between phases ("Phase 1 complete — continue to Whispers? [y/N]").
- **Final validation:** After all phases, calls `scripts/validate-eternal.sh` for cross-host tests (DNS, LDAP, VLAN isolation, GPU detection).

### Validation Layer: `scripts/validate-eternal.sh`
**Behavior:**
- Cross-host tests: DNS resolution (10.0.10.10), LDAP (port 389), Pi-hole (10.0.10.11).
- Host-specific tests: Samba AD (rylan-dc), osTicket (rylan-pi), Ollama + Loki (rylan-ai).
- VLAN isolation: Ping from VLAN 10 to VLAN 90 must fail (blocked by policy).
- Success: All tests PASS or SKIP; no FAIL; exit code 0.

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Junior-Proof Deployment:** Each phase ≤300 lines, clear input/output, validation built-in. A junior engineer at 3 AM can run `sudo ./scripts/ignite.sh` without questions.
2. **Atomic Rollback:** If phase 3 fails, operators can revert just `02-declarative-config/policy-table.yaml` and re-run Phase 3 without touching identity or hardening.
3. **Testability:** CI pipeline validates each phase independently (`validate-secrets`, `validate-whispers`, `validate-perimeter` jobs).
4. **RTO: <15 minutes:** Each phase ≤15 min; total ≤45 min. Measurable via `orchestrator.sh` nightly validation.
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Ops team documents three simple runbooks instead of one 1000-line monolith.

### Negative (Mitigated)
1. **No Concurrency:** Phases run sequentially, not in parallel. **Mitigation:** 45 min total is acceptable; parallelization defers to Phase 4 (future).
2. **State Dependency:** Phase 3 assumes Phase 1 and 2 completed. **Mitigation:** Validation checks in each phase ensure prerequisites.
3. **Manual Confirmation:** `ignite.sh` prompts require human interaction (non-automated). **Mitigation:** `--yes` flag can be added for fully automated runs.

### Compliance
- **Presidio PII Redaction:** Integrated in `app/redactor.py` (lazy-loaded, E402/F401 safe).
- **Loki Audit Triggers:** All policy changes logged (per INSTRUCTION-SET-ETERNAL-v1.md).
- **10-Rule Firewall Limit:** Enforced in `02-declarative-config/policy-table.yaml` and CI job `firewall-rule-count`.
